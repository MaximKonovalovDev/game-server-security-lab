# Runtime Management

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the MCP Server Fuzzer's runtime management system, including process management, watchdog monitoring, and async execution capabilities.

## Overview

The runtime management system provides robust, asynchronous subprocess lifecycle management for transports and target servers under test. It consists of three main components:

- **ProcessManager**: Fully async process lifecycle management
- **ProcessWatchdog**: Automated monitoring and termination of hanging processes
- **AsyncFuzzExecutor**: Controlled concurrency and error handling for fuzzing operations

## ProcessManager

The `ProcessManager` provides fully asynchronous subprocess lifecycle management with comprehensive process tracking and signal handling.

### Construction Patterns

- **Default wiring**: `ProcessManager.from_config()` constructs a manager with default watchdog/registry/signal handler/lifecycle/monitor components.
- **Custom wiring**: You can instantiate collaborators yourself and pass them to the `ProcessManager` constructor to fully control dependencies (useful in tests).

### Core Features

- **Async Process Creation**: Uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for non-blocking process spawning
- **Process Registration**: Automatically registers processes with the watchdog for monitoring
- **Signal Handling**: Supports graceful termination (SIGTERM) and force kill (SIGKILL) with process-group signaling
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains comprehensive process state including start time, status, and configuration
- **Cleanup Management**: Automatic cleanup of finished processes to prevent resource leaks

### Process Lifecycle

1. **Start**: Process is created with asyncio, registered with watchdog, and tracked in manager
2. **Monitor**: Watchdog monitors for hangs and inactivity using activity callbacks
3. **Stop**: Graceful termination with escalation to force kill if needed
4. **Cleanup**: Process is unregistered from watchdog and removed from tracking

### Configuration Options

```python
@dataclass
class ProcessConfig:
    command: List[str]                    # Command and arguments to execute
    cwd: Optional[Union[str, Path]] = None  # Working directory
    env: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None     # Environment variables
    timeout: float = 30.0                    # Default timeout for operations
    auto_kill: bool = True                  # Whether to auto-kill hanging processes
    name: str = "unknown"                   # Human-readable name for logging
    activity_callback: Optional[Callable[[], float]] = None  # Activity callback
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Process Management

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.manager import ProcessManager, ProcessConfig

async def basic_process_management():
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config()

    # Start a process
    config = ProcessConfig(
        command=["python", "my_server.py"],
        name="stdio_server",
        timeout=60.0
    )
    process = await manager.start_process(config)

    # Get process status
    status = await manager.get_process_status(process.pid)
    print(f"Process status: {status}")

    # Stop the process gracefully
    await manager.stop_process(process.pid)

    # Shutdown manager
    await manager.shutdown()
```

#### Process with Activity Monitoring

```python
import time

async def process_with_activity_monitoring():
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config()

    # Activity callback that reports current time
    def activity_callback():
        return time.time()

    config = ProcessConfig(
        command=["python", "long_running_server.py"],
        name="long_server",
        activity_callback=activity_callback,
        timeout=120.0
    )

    process = await manager.start_process(config)

    # Update activity periodically
    for _ in range(10):
        await manager.update_activity(process.pid)
        await asyncio.sleep(5)

    await manager.stop_process(process.pid)
    await manager.shutdown()
```

#### Multiple Process Management

```python
async def multiple_process_management():
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config()

    # Start multiple processes
    processes = []
    for i in range(3):
        config = ProcessConfig(
            command=["python", f"worker_{i}.py"],
            name=f"worker_{i}",
            timeout=30.0
        )
        process = await manager.start_process(config)
        processes.append(process)

    # List all processes
    all_processes = await manager.list_processes()
    print(f"Managing {len(all_processes)} processes")

    # Get overall statistics
    stats = await manager.get_stats()
    print(f"Process statistics: {stats}")

    # Stop all processes
    await manager.stop_all_processes()
    await manager.shutdown()
```

### Custom Signal Strategies

`SignalDispatcher` supports dependency injection of custom signal strategies,
enabling extension without modifying core code. Strategies can be registered
at construction time or runtime.

#### Strategy Registration Pattern

##### Method 1: Dependency Injection at Construction

```python
import logging
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.signals import (
    ProcessRegistry,
    ProcessSignalStrategy,
    SignalDispatcher,
)


class CustomTermStrategy(ProcessSignalStrategy):
    def __init__(self, registry: ProcessRegistry, logger: logging.Logger) -> None:
        self._registry = registry
        self._logger = logger

    async def send(self, pid: int, process_info=None) -> bool:
        # Custom termination logic using injected dependencies
        return True


class MyCustomStrategy(ProcessSignalStrategy):
    async def send(self, pid: int, process_info=None) -> bool:
        # Add your own behavior here
        return True


registry = ProcessRegistry()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Create with custom strategies
custom_strategies = {
    "timeout": CustomTermStrategy(registry, logger),
    "custom": MyCustomStrategy(),
}
dispatcher = SignalDispatcher.from_config(
    registry,
    logger,
    strategies=custom_strategies,
    register_defaults=True,  # Still register defaults, custom overrides them
)

# Or use only custom strategies
dispatcher = SignalDispatcher.from_config(
    registry,
    logger,
    strategies=custom_strategies,
    register_defaults=False,  # No default strategies
)
```

##### Method 2: Runtime Registration

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.signals import ProcessSignalStrategy
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.manager import ProcessManager

class NoopSignal(ProcessSignalStrategy):
    async def send(self, pid: int, process_info=None) -> bool:
        return True  # Custom behavior

manager = ProcessManager.from_config()
manager.signal_dispatcher.register_strategy("noop", NoopSignal())

# Override existing strategy
manager.signal_dispatcher.register_strategy("timeout", CustomTermStrategy())
```

##### Method 3: Strategy Management

```python
# List all registered strategies
strategies = manager.signal_dispatcher.list_strategies()
# Returns: ["timeout", "force", "interrupt", "noop"]

# Unregister a strategy
manager.signal_dispatcher.unregister_strategy("noop")

# Check if strategy exists
if "custom" in manager.signal_dispatcher.list_strategies():
    # Use custom strategy
    pass
```

#### Benefits

- **Extensibility**: Add new signal types without modifying core code
- **Testability**: Inject mock strategies for testing
- **Flexibility**: Override default strategies or use custom-only configurations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between strategy interface and implementation

## ProcessWatchdog

The `ProcessWatchdog` provides automated monitoring and termination of hanging processes with configurable thresholds and activity tracking.

### Monitoring Features

- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors process activity through callbacks or timestamps
- **Hang Detection**: Identifies processes that haven't been active for configured timeout periods
- **Automatic Termination**: Can automatically kill hanging processes based on policy
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Separate thresholds for warning, timeout, and force kill

### Configuration Options

```python
@dataclass
class WatchdogConfig:
    check_interval: float = 1.0      # How often to check processes (seconds)
    process_timeout: float = 30.0    # Time before process is considered hanging (seconds)
    extra_buffer: float = 5.0        # Extra time before auto-kill (seconds)
    max_hang_time: float = 60.0      # Maximum time before force kill (seconds)
    auto_kill: bool = True          # Whether to automatically kill hanging processes
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Watchdog Usage

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime import (
    ProcessConfig,
    ProcessRegistry,
    ProcessWatchdog,
    SignalDispatcher,
    WatchdogConfig,
)


async def basic_watchdog_usage():
    config = WatchdogConfig(check_interval=2.0, process_timeout=30.0, auto_kill=True)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    registry = ProcessRegistry()
    signals = SignalDispatcher(registry, logger)
    watchdog = ProcessWatchdog(registry, signals, config, logger=logger)
    await watchdog.start()

    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("python", "my_server.py")
    await registry.register(
        process.pid,
        process,
        ProcessConfig(command=["python", "my_server.py"], name="stdio_server"),
    )
    await watchdog.update_activity(process.pid)

    # One-off scan (the background loop runs when start() is called)
    await watchdog.scan_once(await registry.snapshot())
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    await watchdog.stop()
```

#### Watchdog with Activity Callbacks

```python
import asyncio
import logging
import time
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime import (
    ProcessConfig,
    ProcessRegistry,
    ProcessWatchdog,
    SignalDispatcher,
    WatchdogConfig,
)


async def watchdog_with_activity():
    registry = ProcessRegistry()
    signals = SignalDispatcher(registry, logging.getLogger(__name__))
    watchdog = ProcessWatchdog(
        registry,
        signals,
        WatchdogConfig(check_interval=1.0, process_timeout=10.0, auto_kill=True),
    )
    await watchdog.start()

    # Activity callback that simulates periodic activity
    last_activity = time.time()

    def activity_callback():
        nonlocal last_activity
        if time.time() - last_activity > 5:
            last_activity = time.time()
        return last_activity

    process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("python", "server.py")
    await registry.register(
        process.pid,
        process,
        ProcessConfig(
            command=["python", "server.py"],
            name="server",
            activity_callback=activity_callback,
        ),
    )
    await watchdog.update_activity(process.pid)

    await asyncio.sleep(20)
    await watchdog.stop()
```

#### Context Manager Usage

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime import (
    ProcessConfig,
    ProcessRegistry,
    ProcessWatchdog,
    SignalDispatcher,
    WatchdogConfig,
)


async def watchdog_context_manager():
    registry = ProcessRegistry()
    dispatcher = SignalDispatcher(registry, logging.getLogger(__name__))

    async with ProcessWatchdog(
        registry, dispatcher, WatchdogConfig(auto_kill=True)
    ) as watchdog:
        process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("python", "server.py")
        await registry.register(
            process.pid,
            process,
            ProcessConfig(command=["python", "server.py"], name="server"),
        )
        await watchdog.update_activity(process.pid)
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
```

### API Reference

#### ProcessWatchdog Methods

- `async start() -> None`
  - Start the watchdog monitoring loop

- `async stop() -> None`
  - Stop the watchdog monitoring loop and await the loop task

- `async scan_once(processes: dict[int, ProcessRecord]) -> dict[str, Any]`
  - Run a single hang-detection pass against a registry snapshot

- `async update_activity(pid: int) -> None`
  - Update the last-activity timestamp for a tracked pid

- `async get_stats() -> dict`
  - Lightweight statistics including last scan time and registry counts

Note: processes are registered with the `ProcessRegistry` (or via `ProcessLifecycle`),
and the watchdog reads that shared registry instead of keeping its own table.

## AsyncFuzzExecutor

The `AsyncFuzzExecutor` provides controlled concurrency for fuzzing operations using semaphore-based concurrency control.

### Concurrency Control

- **Bounded Concurrency**: Uses semaphore to limit concurrent operations
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple operations concurrently with result collection
- **Thread Pool**: Handles both async and sync operations via thread pool
- **Hypothesis Integration**: Wraps Hypothesis strategies to prevent asyncio deadlocks

### Configuration Options

```python
class AsyncFuzzExecutor:
    def __init__(
        self,
        max_concurrency: int = 5,      # Maximum concurrent operations
    ):
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Batch Operations

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.executor import AsyncFuzzExecutor

async def basic_executor_usage():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=3)

    try:
        # Define an async operation
        async def sample_operation(value):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            return f"processed_{value}"

        # Prepare operations as (function, args, kwargs) tuples
        operations = [
            (sample_operation, [i], {}) for i in range(10)
        ]

        # Execute batch with concurrency control
        results = await executor.execute_batch(operations)

        print(f"Successful results: {len(results['results'])}")
        print(f"Errors: {len(results['errors'])}")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

#### Error Handling

```python
async def batch_with_errors():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=5)

    try:
        # Operation that may fail
        async def operation(x):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            if x % 3 == 0:  # Some operations fail
                raise Exception(f"Operation {x} failed")
            return f"result_{x}"

        # Prepare operations
        operations = [(operation, [i], {}) for i in range(10)]

        # Execute batch - errors are automatically collected
        results = await executor.execute_batch(operations)

        print(f"Successful: {len(results['results'])}")
        print(f"Failed: {len(results['errors'])}")

        # Handle errors
        for error in results['errors']:
            print(f"Error: {error}")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

#### Mixed Async and Sync Operations

```python
async def mixed_operations():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=5)

    try:
        # Async I/O-bound operation
        async def async_operation():
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            return "async_result"

        # Sync CPU-bound operation (runs in thread pool)
        def sync_operation():
            return sum(range(1_000_000))

        operations = [
            (async_operation, [], {}) for _ in range(5)
        ] + [
            (sync_operation, [], {}) for _ in range(5)
        ]

        results = await executor.execute_batch(operations)
        print(f"Mixed operations: {len(results['results'])} successful")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

#### Hypothesis Strategy Integration

```python
from hypothesis import strategies as st

async def hypothesis_example():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=3)

    try:
        # Use Hypothesis strategy without asyncio deadlocks
        int_strategy = st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100)

        # Generate values safely in thread pool
        value = await executor.run_hypothesis_strategy(int_strategy)
        print(f"Generated value: {value}")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

### API Reference

#### AsyncFuzzExecutor Methods

- `async execute_batch(operations: List[Tuple[Callable, List[Any], Dict[str, Any]]]) -> Dict[str, List[Any]]`
  - Execute a batch of operations concurrently with bounded concurrency
  - Operations format: `[(function, args, kwargs), ...]`
  - Returns dictionary with `'results'` and `'errors'` lists
  - Errors are automatically collected; successful results in `'results'`

- `async run_hypothesis_strategy(strategy: st.SearchStrategy) -> Any`
  - Run a Hypothesis strategy in thread pool to prevent asyncio deadlocks
  - Returns generated value from the strategy

- `async shutdown() -> None`
  - Shutdown the executor and clean up thread pool resources
  - Waits for thread pool to complete all tasks

            timeout=60.0
        )
        server_process = await manager.start_process(server_config)

        # Define fuzzing operations
        async def fuzz_operation():

```

### Transport Integration Example

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.transport.stdio import StdioTransport
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.manager import ProcessManager, ProcessConfig

class ManagedStdioTransport(StdioTransport):
    def __init__(self, endpoint: str, manager: ProcessManager):
        super().__init__(endpoint)
        self.manager = manager
        self.process = None

    async def _start_process(self):
        """Start the managed process."""
        config = ProcessConfig(
            command=self.endpoint.split(),
            name="stdio_server",
            timeout=30.0
        )
        self.process = await self.manager.start_process(config)
        return self.process

    async def _stop_process(self):
        """Stop the managed process."""
        if self.process:
            await self.manager.stop_process(self.process.pid)
            self.process = None

        tools = await transport.get_tools()
        print(f"Available tools: {[tool['name'] for tool in tools]}")
    finally:
        await transport.disconnect()
        await manager.shutdown()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Process Not Starting

**Symptoms**: Process fails to start or immediately exits
**Solutions**:
- Check command path and arguments
- Verify working directory exists
- Check environment variables
- Review process logs for error messages

#### Process Hanging

**Symptoms**: Process appears to hang and doesn't respond
**Solutions**:
- Check watchdog configuration and timeout settings
- Verify activity callbacks are working correctly
- Review process logs for deadlocks or infinite loops
- Consider increasing timeout values

#### High Resource Usage

**Symptoms**: High CPU or memory usage during fuzzing
**Solutions**:
- Reduce `max_concurrency` in AsyncFuzzExecutor
- Increase `check_interval` in ProcessWatchdog
- Implement proper cleanup in activity callbacks
- Monitor process resource usage

#### Signal Handling Issues

**Symptoms**: Processes not terminating properly
**Solutions**:
- Check if process handles SIGTERM correctly
- Verify process group signaling on POSIX systems
- Consider using force kill for unresponsive processes
- Review process cleanup code

### Debug Configuration

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Configure watchdog with debug settings
debug_config = WatchdogConfig(
    check_interval=0.5,      # More frequent checks
    process_timeout=10.0,     # Shorter timeout for testing
    auto_kill=False          # Disable auto-kill for debugging
)

# Configure executor with debug settings
debug_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(
    max_concurrency=1        # Single operation for debugging
)
```

### Performance Tuning

#### Optimizing Concurrency

```python
# For CPU-bound operations
cpu_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=os.cpu_count())

# For I/O-bound operations
io_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=os.cpu_count() * 2)

# For network operations
network_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=10)
```

#### Optimizing Watchdog Performance

```python
# For high-frequency monitoring
fast_watchdog = WatchdogConfig(
    check_interval=0.1,
    process_timeout=5.0,
    auto_kill=True
)

# For low-frequency monitoring
slow_watchdog = WatchdogConfig(
    check_interval=5.0,
    process_timeout=60.0,
    auto_kill=True
)
```

This comprehensive runtime management system provides the foundation for robust, scalable fuzzing operations with proper process lifecycle management and error handling.

This understanding will help you:
- Write code that fits the existing architecture
- Identify the right place for new features
- Understand why certain design decisions were made
- Propose improvements that align with the project's goals

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher

- Git
- pip or conda for package management

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone --recursive https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-server-fuzzer.git
cd mcp-server-fuzzer

# If you already cloned without submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Verify setup
mcp-fuzzer --help
```

### MCP Spec Submodule

This repo vendors the MCP spec as a git submodule at `schemas/mcp-spec`. The
spec guard schema validator (`mcp_fuzzer/spec_guard/schema_validator.py`) reads
schemas from `schemas/mcp-spec/schema/{version}/schema.json`, and the current
default version is `2025-06-18`. CI already initializes submodules (see
`e2e-test.yml` with `submodules: recursive`).

To bump the spec version:

1. Update the `schemas/mcp-spec` submodule to the desired tagged release
   (recommended) or commit. The current submodule pin is
   `c1e0b4d39a630fd87807602c6ace6eefc15154a5`.
2. Ensure the target schema directory exists under
   `schemas/mcp-spec/schema/{version}`.
3. Update the default version in `mcp_fuzzer/spec_guard/schema_validator.py`
   if needed.
4. Verify schema loading with `pytest tests/unit/spec_guard/test_schema_validator.py`.

> A project-wide `requirements.txt` is included for quick bootstrapping.
> After activating your virtual environment you can also run
> `pip install -r requirements.txt` to pull in every dependency the docs and
> examples rely on.

### Interactive Code Exploration

Once the dependencies are installed, open an interactive session with
`python3 -i` from the project root and paste the snippet below. It gives you a
peek into how the client wires transports and tool fuzzers together without
having to run the entire CLI:

```python
import asyncio
from mcp_fuzzer.transport import build_driver
from mcp_fuzzer.client import MCPFuzzerClient


async def explore_client():
    transport = build_driver("http", "http://localhost:8000", timeout=5.0)
    client = MCPFuzzerClient(transport=transport, safety_enabled=False)
    print(f"Initialized {transport.__class__.__name__} at {transport.url}")
    print(
        "Tool fuzzer concurrency:",
        client.tool_client.tool_fuzzer.executor.max_concurrency,
    )
    await client.cleanup()


asyncio.run(explore_client())
```

Feel free to swap in any endpoint that matches your local MCP server to inspect
the objects that back the CLI.

> Need to poke at coroutines without writing helper scripts? Python ships an
> asyncio-aware REPL: run `python3 -m asyncio` and you get a prompt that accepts
> top-level `await`. Paste the snippet above, drop the final `asyncio.run(...)`,
> and simply type `await explore_client()` to drive the coroutine directly.

### Development Dependencies

The project includes development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "mypy>=1.0.0",
    "pre-commit>=3.5.0",
    "tox>=4.0.0"
]
docs = [
    "mkdocs>=1.5.0",
    "mkdocs-material>=9.0.0",
    "mkdocs-minify-plugin>=0.7.0"
]
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=mcp_fuzzer --cov-report=html

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/unit/transport/test_transport.py
pytest tests/test_cli.py

#Run Individual test
pytest tests/unit/transport/test_transport.py::test_build_driver_http

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v -s

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### Test Safety Features

End-to-end tests often spawn local MCP servers and can trigger external
processes. Use the same safety features that the CLI exposes when running tests
manually:

- Argument-level safety hooks are enabled by default; avoid `--no-safety`.
  Use `--enable-safety-system` when you need system command blocking.
- Provide a dedicated sandbox directory via `MCP_FUZZER_FS_ROOT` or `--fs-root`
  to contain any files created by tools under test.
- When you intentionally disable safety (for example, to fuzz filesystem-heavy
  tools), run inside a disposable VM or container. There is no automatic
  environment detection, so treat these flags as the final line of defense.

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=mcp_fuzzer --cov-report=html

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html  # On macOS
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # On Linux
start htmlcov/index.html  # On Windows
```

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run linting with ruff
ruff check mcp_fuzzer tests

# Fix linting issues automatically
ruff check --fix mcp_fuzzer tests

# Format code with black
black mcp_fuzzer tests

# Type checking with mypy
mypy mcp_fuzzer
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3

  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.0.270
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [types-all]
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide

- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (enforced by Ruff)
  - Break long lines across multiple statements
  - Use implicit line continuation for function signatures and strings
  - Avoid f-strings without placeholders

- **F-strings**: Always include placeholders when using f-strings
  - Use regular strings for static messages
  - Extract complex expressions to variables if needed

- **Imports**: Use absolute imports, group by standard library, third-party, local

- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values

- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all public functions and classes

- **Logging**: Use appropriate logging levels
  - DEBUG: Tool call notifications and detailed execution flow
  - INFO: Important state changes and user-facing information
  - WARNING: Potential issues that don't prevent execution
  - ERROR: Errors that require attention

## Adding New Features

### Transport Protocols

To add a new transport protocol:

1. **Create transport class** in `mcp_fuzzer/transport/`
2. **Implement TransportDriver interface**
3. **Add to transport.catalog**
4. **Write comprehensive tests**
5. **Update documentation**

```python
# Example: Custom Transport Protocol
from mcp_fuzzer.transport import TransportDriver

class CustomTransport(TransportDriver):
    def __init__(self, endpoint: str, **kwargs):
        self.endpoint = endpoint
        self.config = kwargs

    async def send_request(self, method: str, params=None):
        # Your implementation
        pass

    async def send_raw(self, payload):
        # Your implementation
        pass

    async def send_notification(self, method: str, params=None):
        # Your implementation
        pass
```

### Fuzzing Strategies

To add new fuzzing strategies:

1. **Create strategy class** in appropriate directory
2. **Implement strategy interface**
3. **Add to strategy manager**
4. **Write tests**
5. **Update documentation**

```python
# Example: Custom Fuzzing Strategy
class CustomToolStrategy:
    def generate_test_data(self, tool_schema: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Your data generation logic
        return {"custom_param": "custom_value"}
```

### Safety Features

To introduce new safety capabilities:

1. **Extend or wrap `SafetyFilter`** (for argument-level safety hooks) or add helpers
   under `safety_system/blocking`, `detection`, or `filesystem` as appropriate.
2. **Expose configuration hooks** (CLI flags or config file entries) when needed.
3. **Write unit tests** covering the new patterns, shims, or sandbox behaviors.
4. **Document the feature** so operators understand the new protections.

## Working with Internal APIs

This section provides code examples for working with internal components of MCP Server Fuzzer. These are useful when extending the fuzzer or building custom tooling.

You can save all those code snippet as test.py and run it as `python -i test.py`
and debug objects inside the repl

### Process Management

The `ProcessManager` provides robust process lifecycle management with watchdog monitoring.

#### Basic Process Management

```python
import asyncio
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime.manager import ProcessManager, ProcessConfig
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.runtime import WatchdogConfig

async def basic_process_management():
    # Configure watchdog
    watchdog_config = WatchdogConfig(
        check_interval=1.0,
        process_timeout=30.0,
        auto_kill=True
    )

    # Create process manager
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config(watchdog_config)

    try:
        # Start a test server
        config = ProcessConfig(
            command=["python", "my_server.py"],
            name="stdio_server",
            timeout=60.0
        )
        process = await manager.start_process(config)

        # Monitor process
        status = await manager.get_process_status(process.pid)
        print(f"Process {process.pid} status: {status['status']}")

        # Let it run for a while
        await asyncio.sleep(10)

        # Stop gracefully
        await manager.stop_process(process.pid)

    finally:
        await manager.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(basic_process_management())
```

#### Process with Activity Monitoring

```python
import time

async def process_with_activity_monitoring():
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config()

    # Activity callback for hang detection
    last_activity = time.time()

    def activity_callback():
        nonlocal last_activity
        return last_activity

    def update_activity():
        nonlocal last_activity
        last_activity = time.time()

    config = ProcessConfig(
        command=["python", "long_running_server.py"],
        name="long_server",
        activity_callback=activity_callback,
        timeout=120.0
    )

    process = await manager.start_process(config)

    try:
        # Simulate periodic activity updates
        for i in range(20):
            update_activity()
            await manager.update_activity(process.pid)
            await asyncio.sleep(2)

    finally:
        await manager.stop_process(process.pid)
        await manager.shutdown()
```

#### Multiple Process Management

```python
async def multiple_process_management():
    manager = ProcessManager.from_config()

    try:
        # Start multiple worker processes
        processes = []
        for i in range(3):
            config = ProcessConfig(
                command=["python", f"worker_{i}.py"],
                name=f"worker_{i}",
                timeout=30.0
            )
            process = await manager.start_process(config)
            processes.append(process)

        # Monitor all processes
        all_processes = await manager.list_processes()
        print(f"Managing {len(all_processes)} processes")

        # Get statistics
        stats = await manager.get_stats()
        print(f"Process statistics: {stats}")

        # Wait for all processes to complete
        await asyncio.sleep(30)

    finally:
        # Stop all processes
        await manager.stop_all_processes()
        await manager.shutdown()
```

### AsyncFuzzExecutor

The `AsyncFuzzExecutor` provides concurrency control for fuzzing operations.

#### Basic Executor Usage

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.fuzz_engine.executor import AsyncFuzzExecutor

async def basic_executor_usage():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=3)

    try:
        # Execute batch operations
        async def sample_operation(value):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            return f"processed_{value}"

        # Prepare operations as (function, args, kwargs) tuples
        operations = [
            (sample_operation, [i], {}) for i in range(10)
        ]

        # Execute batch with concurrency control
        results = await executor.execute_batch(operations)

        print(f"Successful results: {len(results['results'])}")
        print(f"Errors: {len(results['errors'])}")

        for result in results['results']:
            print(f"Result: {result}")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

#### Batch Operations with Error Handling

```python
async def batch_operations_example():
    executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=5)

    try:
        # Define multiple operations (some will fail)
        async def operation(x):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            if x % 3 == 0:  # Some operations fail
                raise Exception(f"Operation {x} failed")
            return f"result_{x}"

        # Prepare operations list
        operations = [(operation, [i], {}) for i in range(10)]

        # Execute batch - automatically collects results and errors
        results = await executor.execute_batch(operations)

        print(f"Successful results: {len(results['results'])}")
        print(f"Errors: {len(results['errors'])}")

        # Process successful results
        for result in results['results']:
            print(f"Success: {result}")

        # Handle errors
        for error in results['errors']:
            print(f"Error: {error}")

    finally:
        await executor.shutdown()
```

#### Custom Concurrency Configuration

```python
async def custom_executor_configuration():
    # High concurrency for I/O-bound operations
    io_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=20)

    # Low concurrency for CPU-bound operations
    cpu_executor = AsyncFuzzExecutor(max_concurrency=4)

    try:
        # I/O-bound operations
        async def io_operation():
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate I/O
            return "io_result"

        # CPU-bound operations (sync function runs in thread pool)
        def cpu_operation():
            # Simulate CPU work
            return sum(range(1_000_000))

        # Execute with appropriate executor
        io_results = await io_executor.execute_batch([
            (io_operation, [], {}) for _ in range(20)
        ])

        cpu_results = await cpu_executor.execute_batch([
            (cpu_operation, [], {}) for _ in range(4)
        ])

        print(f"IO results: {len(io_results['results'])}")
        print(f"CPU results: {len(cpu_results['results'])}")

    finally:
        await io_executor.shutdown()
        await cpu_executor.shutdown()
```

### Custom Transport Implementation

To create a custom transport protocol:

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.transport import TransportDriver

class CustomTransport(TransportDriver):
    def __init__(self, endpoint, **kwargs):
        self.endpoint = endpoint
        self.config = kwargs

    async def send_request(self, method: str, params=None):
        # Your custom implementation
        return {"result": "custom_response"}
```

Using a custom transport:

```python
from mcp_fuzzer.client import MCPFuzzerClient

# Create custom transport
transport = CustomTransport("custom-endpoint")

# Use with fuzzer client (with optional concurrency control)
client = MCPFuzzerClient(
    transport,
    max_concurrency=10  # Optional: Control concurrent operations
)

# Run fuzzing
await client.fuzz_tools(runs=10)
```

### Report Analysis and Processing

#### JSON Report Processing

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

def analyze_fuzzing_report(report_path):
    with open(report_path, 'r') as f:
        report = json.load(f)

    # Extract metadata
    metadata = report['metadata']
    print(f"Session: {metadata['session_id']}")
    print(f"Mode: {metadata['mode']}")
    start = datetime.fromisoformat(metadata['start_time'])
    end = datetime.fromisoformat(metadata['end_time'])
    print(f"Duration: {end - start}")

    # Analyze tool results
    tool_results = report.get('tool_results', {})
    for tool_name, results in tool_results.items():
        success_count = sum(1 for r in results if r.get('success', False))
        total_count = len(results)
        success_rate = (success_count / total_count) * 100 if total_count > 0 else 0

        print(f"Tool {tool_name}: {success_rate:.1f}% success rate")

    # Analyze safety data
    safety_data = report.get('safety_data', {})
    if safety_data:
        blocked_operations = safety_data.get('blocked_operations', [])
        print(f"Blocked operations: {len(blocked_operations)}")

        for operation in blocked_operations[:5]:  # Show first 5
            print(f"  - {operation['operation']}: {operation['reason']}")

# Usage
analyze_fuzzing_report(
    "reports/fuzzing_report_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.json"
)
```

#### Safety Report Analysis

```python
import json

def analyze_safety_report(safety_report_path):
    with open(safety_report_path, 'r') as f:
        safety_report = json.load(f)

    # Analyze blocked operations by type
    blocked_by_type = {}
    for operation in safety_report.get('blocked_operations', []):
        op_type = operation.get('operation_type', 'unknown')
        blocked_by_type[op_type] = blocked_by_type.get(op_type, 0) + 1

    print("Blocked operations by type:")
    for op_type, count in blocked_by_type.items():
        print(f"  {op_type}: {count}")

    # Analyze risk levels
    risk_levels = safety_report.get('risk_assessments', {})
    print("\nRisk level distribution:")
    for level, count in risk_levels.items():
        print(f"  {level}: {count}")

    # Show recent blocked operations
    recent_blocks = safety_report.get('recent_blocks', [])
    print(f"\nRecent blocked operations ({len(recent_blocks)}):")
    for block in recent_blocks[-5:]:  # Last 5
        print(f"  - {block['timestamp']}: {block['operation']}")

# Usage

    "reports/safety_report_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.json"
)
```

#### Programmatic Report Creation

```python
from pathlib import Path
from mcp_fuzzer.reports.reporter import FuzzerReporter


async def custom_report_generation():
    reporter = FuzzerReporter(
        config_provider={
            "output": {
                "directory": "custom_reports",
                "types": ["fuzzing_results", "safety_summary"],
                "compress": False,
            }
        }
    )

    reporter.set_fuzzing_metadata(
        mode="tools",
        protocol="stdio",
        endpoint="test-endpoint",
        runs=3,

#### Report Comparison

```python
import json

def compare_reports(report1_path, report2_path):
    with open(report1_path, 'r') as f:
        report1 = json.load(f)

    with open(report2_path, 'r') as f:
        report2 = json.load(f)

    # Compare success rates
    def get_success_rate(report):
        tool_results = report.get('tool_results', {})
        total_success = 0
        total_runs = 0

        for tool_name, results in tool_results.items():
            success_count = sum(1 for r in results if r.get('success', False))
            total_success += success_count
            total_runs += len(results)

        return (total_success / total_runs * 100.0) if total_runs else 0.0

    rate1 = get_success_rate(report1)
    rate2 = get_success_rate(report2)

    print(f"Report 1 success rate: {rate1:.1f}%")
    print(f"Report 2 success rate: {rate2:.1f}%")
    print(f"Improvement: {rate2 - rate1:.1f} percentage points")

    # Compare safety data
    safety1 = report1.get('safety_data', {}).get('blocked_operations', [])
    safety2 = report2.get('safety_data', {}).get('blocked_operations', [])

    print(f"Report 1 blocked operations: {len(safety1)}")
    print(f"Report 2 blocked operations: {len(safety2)}")
